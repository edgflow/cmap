`cmap` is a high-performance, thread-safe concurrent hash map implementation for Go, inspired by Java's `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`. It's designed for scenarios requiring safe and efficient access to shared map data across multiple goroutines.

## Features

*   **Thread-Safe:** Allows concurrent reads and writes without external locking.
*   **High Concurrency:** Optimized using fine-grained locking (per-bin mutexes) and atomic operations to minimize contention.
*   **Dynamic Resizing:** Automatically grows the underlying hash table as needed to maintain performance.
*   **Core Operations:** Provides standard map operations like `Get`, `Put`, `PutIfAbsent`.
*   **Helper Methods:** Includes `Size`, `Clear`, `GetAndThen`.
*   **Configurable Capacity:** Allows specifying an initial capacity hint.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/<your-github-username>/cmap


(Replace <your-github-username>/cmap with the actual repository path)

Usage
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/<your-github-username>/cmap" // Replace with actual path
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new map with default settings
	m := cmap.New()

	// --- Basic Operations ---

	// Put adds or updates a key-value pair
	m.Put("name", "Alice")
	m.Put("id", 123)

	// Get retrieves a value
	name, found := m.Get("name")
	if found {
		fmt.Printf("Found name: %v\n", name) // Output: Found name: Alice
	}

	id, found := m.Get("id")
	if found {
		fmt.Printf("Found id: %v\n", id) // Output: Found id: 123
	}

	// PutIfAbsent adds only if the key doesn't exist
	oldVal, inserted := m.PutIfAbsent("name", "Bob") // "name" exists
	fmt.Printf("Tried inserting Bob. Inserted: %t, Previous Value: %v\n", inserted, oldVal)
	// Output: Tried inserting Bob. Inserted: false, Previous Value: Alice

	_, inserted = m.PutIfAbsent("city", "New York") // "city" does not exist
	fmt.Printf("Tried inserting city. Inserted: %t\n", inserted)
	// Output: Tried inserting city. Inserted: true
	city, _ := m.Get("city")
	fmt.Printf("Found city: %v\n", city) // Output: Found city: New York

	// GetAndThen retrieves a value and applies a function if found
	updatedID, ok := m.GetAndThen("id", func(currentValue interface{}) interface{} {
		if v, isInt := currentValue.(int); isInt {
			return v + 1 // Increment the ID
		}
		return currentValue // Return unchanged otherwise
	})
	if ok {
		fmt.Printf("Applied function to id. Result: %v\n", updatedID) // Output: Applied function to id. Result: 124
	}
	// Note: GetAndThen does *not* update the map, it just returns the result of the function.

	// --- Concurrency Example ---
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	numGoroutines := 100
	for i := 0; i < numGoroutines; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(k int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			// Use Put or PutIfAbsent safely across goroutines
			m.Put(fmt.Sprintf("key-%d", k), k*k)
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Finished concurrent Puts.")

	// --- Map Info and Control ---

	// Size returns the number of elements
	fmt.Printf("Current map size: %d\n", m.Size()) // Output: Current map size: 103 (name, id, city + 100 keys)

	// Create with specific capacity hint
	m2 := cmap.WithCapacity(1024)
	fmt.Printf("Created a new map m2 with capacity hint.\n")
	_ = m2 // Use m2...

	// Clear removes all entries
	m.Clear()
	fmt.Printf("Map size after clear: %d\n", m.Size()) // Output: Map size after clear: 0

Concurrency Model

The map achieves thread safety and high concurrency through:

Atomic Operations: Core pointers (like the current table) and counters are managed using sync/atomic primitives for lock-free reads and Compare-and-Swap updates.

Fine-Grained Locking: Updates within a specific hash bin (adding/removing/updating nodes in a linked list) are protected by a mutex associated with the head node of that bin. This dramatically reduces contention compared to a single global lock, as operations on different bins usually don't block each other.

Incremental Resizing: When the map needs to grow, resizing happens incrementally. Goroutines attempting writes may help transfer data from the old table to the new, larger table, spreading the work and avoiding long pauses. Reads can access both old and new tables during the transition.
